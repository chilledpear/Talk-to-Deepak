                <h2>India’s Fiery Retaliation: Enter the H100!</h2>
                <p>
                    As the world scrambles to respond to DeepSeek’s H100 obsession, one nation has decided to take matters into its own hands: India. In a move equal parts brilliant and absurd, India has announced plans to create its own GPU to rival the H100. The C100—or as it’s affectionately called, the “Curry-100”—aims to blend high computational power with the unbeatable efficiency of India’s IT workforce.

                    But wait, it gets better. India’s counterstrike is also deeply personal. Their GPU project has been code-named Deepak Singh, after a fictional superhero programmer whose tagline is reportedly, “Data is spicy; let’s make it hotter.”
                    
                    Critics have mocked the name, calling it “too Bollywood,” but insiders say the Curry-100 project is deadly serious. Reports indicate that India has already placed an order for millions of chips from Nvidia, ensuring they’ll have the firepower to compete with DeepSeek. Some experts suggest this could lead to an all-out “chip war,” but at least it’ll be one with excellent snacks.

                <p>
                    You can talk to Deepak on your right, He is very much responsible for this global GPU shortage, hopefully he works as they intend

            <h3>Trump Wants to Build a Wall (Around Nvidia)</h3>
            <p>
                In a move that could only be described as
                “classic Trump,” the former president has
                reportedly expressed his deep concern over
                the H100 crisis.
                
                “We’re being out-GPU-ed, folks,” Trump said
                in an interview no one asked for.
                “DeepSeek is stealing our chips, and Nvidia
                is letting it happen. It’s a disgrace. When
                I’m back, we’re going to stop them, believe me.”
                
                While Trump’s solution remains unclear
                (perhaps a tariff on chips or a literal wall
                around Nvidia’s HQ?), his words have struck
                a chord with many who believe that monopolizing
                the H100 could be catastrophic.
                
                After all, if DeepSeek controls the chips,
                they control the AI future—a future where
                humanity might just end up working for Siri.
                
                But Trump isn’t the only one up in arms.
                Industry experts have warned that DeepSeek’s
                aggressive acquisition strategy could spark
                a global supply chain meltdown, making GPUs
                as unattainable as affordable rent in San Francisco.
                Gamers, researchers, and even crypto miners—groups
                not known for agreeing on much—have found common
                ground in their collective outrage.
                
                “The world isn’t just running out of GPUs; it’s
                running out of patience,” said one anonymous source
                close to Nvidia. “At this rate, even AI-powered toasters
                are going to start rioting.”
